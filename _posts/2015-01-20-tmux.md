*I started to use Screen from the first time I got in touch with Vim. I think it's really
a mistake for me to insist on it. Because there has another awesome tool that is much better
and easy to use that Screen. Today I'll do a introduction for it to you.*

#### Nest Level
1. Terminal(tmux session)
2. Window
3. Pane

One Terminal can have many Windows, one Window can have many Panes.

---

#### Terminal
To create a new tmux session, type `tmux` in a new terminal.  
`C-a d` detach a tmux session  
`tmux attach-session -t n` reattach a tmux session

---

#### Window

`C-a c` new window  
`C-a n` next window  
`C-a p` previous window  
`C-a w` show windows list  
`C-a n` skip to window n  
`C-a &` kill current window  
`C-a "` split  
`C-a %` vsplit  
`C-a o` switch in windows  
`C-a direction key` switch window in direction  
`C-a !` close all windows  
`C-a x` close current window  
`C-a t` funny clock  
`C-a ,` change window name
