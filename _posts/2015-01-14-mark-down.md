#### Compatible with HTML
---
You can use HTML in Markdown. It's a little special for block elements.
There should be one or more blank lines before and after the block. Such as `<div>`, `<table>`, etc.

`<` and `&` in HTML are special characters. It will not be shown generally. If you want to show it, you have to use it's
entity mode '&lt' and '&amp'. In Markdwon, you don't need to concern this, just use what you want to use.

As for paragraph in Markdown, it's a continuous text. There also need to have one or more blank lines before and after it.
If want a `<br />` before the end of the paragraph, you need insert more than two speces.
